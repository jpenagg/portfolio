## What is Site Reliability Engineering?

Site Reliability Engineering is what happens when you ask a software engineer to do operations.

In general, an SRE team is responsible for availability, latency, performance, efficiency, change management, monitoring, emergency response, security, and capacity planning.

First and foremost, SREs are engineers. We apply the principles of computer science and engineering to the design and development of computing systems: generally, large distributed ones.

## Core Principles

SRE is about creating reliability through engineering, not heroics. That usually means:

- **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)** to define what “good” looks like.
- **Error budgets** to balance reliability with the pace of change.
- **Automation** to reduce toil and make systems predictable.
- **Blameless culture** that focuses on learning and prevention.

## Common Responsibilities

Day‑to‑day work varies by company, but the shape is consistent:

- Designing and maintaining resilient systems
- Observability (metrics, logs, tracing) and actionable alerting
- Incident response and post‑incident reviews
- Capacity planning and performance optimization
- Improving developer experience and deployment safety

## How SRE Differs From Traditional Ops

Traditional ops can focus on keeping the lights on. SRE brings engineering rigor:

- Build systems to *prevent* incidents, not just react to them
- Measure reliability with SLOs instead of guessing
- Automate repetitive tasks so teams can ship faster

## Getting Started

If you want to get into SRE, focus on:

- Linux fundamentals and networking basics
- One cloud platform (AWS, GCP, or Azure)
- Infrastructure as code (e.g., Terraform)
- Observability tools (Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry)
